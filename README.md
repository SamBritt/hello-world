# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first time using GitHub, and it seems like it is a tool that every programmer needs to have. I am somewhat experienced with programming, however it has been a good while since I have written any code. I took a break off from school to work, and I have found it hard to get back into the swing of things. This is my first time back, and hopefully isn't my last.
